# Dice-Game

The player must roll the dice, accumulating points which are shown under the "Current". If the player rolls a 1 s/he loses all of her/his "Current" score and it will be the turn of the other player and nothing is added to the total score. You can hold your points and then your turn will pass as well. First player to accumulate up to 100 points will win the game.
